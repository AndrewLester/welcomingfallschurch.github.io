            <h3>Welcoming Week 2018</h3>
            <p>For our first Welcoming Week last fall, the Falls Church City Council honored Welcoming Week with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofFallsChurchGov/photos/a.289986851393/10155423616661394/?type=3&amp;theater">proclamation</a> in support of Welcoming Falls Church. Working together, we can create an environment in which all individuals in the The Little City feel welcome.</p>
            <p>Then, we participated in four awareness building events.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the Falls Church Fall Festival on Saturday, September 15, we met lots of new friends and neighbors who showed their support by enthusiastically holding up a heart sign (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8">see photos</a>). Special thanks to Laura Chaves and Nayoung Lee, two designers who helped us launch Welcoming Falls Church. People asked us great questions about the Welcoming America movement, challenged us about making Falls Church more welcoming with affordable housing options and joined the movement by signing up for activities. We are thankful to Katie Adams, Greg Anderson, Win Dayton, Linda Doornsbosch, Debbie Liang, and Mike Sakata for representing Welcoming Falls Church and helping with our booth.</li>
                <li>The Falls Church Education Foundation welcomed us with open arms at their annual Race for the Schools Fundraiser on Sunday, September 16. Friends - new and old, including Thomas Jefferson - stopped by to show their support by holding up a Welcoming Falls Church sign (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8">see more photos</a>!). Special thanks to Debbie Hiscott for her wholehearted support and allowing us to share our story with a table at the race and to Debbie Liang for representing the movement.</li>
                <li>The Falls Church Elementary PTA welcomed us at their annual Ice Cream Social and Info Fair. Many parents came by our table and expressed interest in joining the movement with their families. We were able to share about a new idea, bridging cultural divides over dinner and dialogue - with native English speaking families, immigrant families, and bridge families who may have lived or traveled abroad or speak a foreign language. Special thanks to Katie Adams who is coordinating these dinners.</li>
                <li>The Willston Multicultural Center invited us to join them for their Fall Festival on Saturday, September 22. It was a wonderful time of meeting neighbors in the broader Falls Church community. Special thanks to Linda Doornbosch for representing Welcoming Falls Church.</li>
