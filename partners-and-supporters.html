    <h1>Partners & Supporters</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church celebrates the efforts of many like-minded people in the community to welcome immigrants and refugees. Local government authorities; community and civic organizations; churches, synagogues, and mosques; and perhaps most importantly individuals and families who befriend neighbors, acquaintances, classmates, are engaging international residents of our community and making welcoming work.</p>
    <p>We are fortunate to live in a community where most residents profess positive sentiments towards immigrants and refugees. The Greater Falls Church area is remarkably diverse, and becoming more so, offering us all everyday opportunities for us to connect with the world, close to home.</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Partners.</span> In order to mobilize our community, we're connecting with like-minded organizations and their leaders and members. We are delighted to have entered into partnerships with the Falls Church City Public Schools and the Falls Church Education Foundation. We thank our FCCPS and FCEdF colleagues for collaboration. In addition, we are delighted to work with two organizations - Spend Yourself Food Pantry, whose goal is to help the hungry and build relationships in a warm and welcoming environment - and Comunidad, a new and locally-rooted non-profit serving the Seven Corners and Culmore communities.</p>
