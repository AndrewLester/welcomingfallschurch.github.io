    <h1>Welcoming Falls Church</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths. Inspired by a national movement called Welcoming America, we are grassroots, apolitical, and public-private in character. We invite you to learn more and to join us.</p>
    <p>Context. Falls Church's history bears testimony to the struggles of African-Americans to attain their rights and freedoms, from Jim Crow through the Civil Rights Movement to today. And Falls Church—especially Greater Falls Church—is becoming more and more diverse. Just as the United States is in the midst of a historical demographic transition, so, too, is Falls Church changing. The public schools of the City of Falls Church play host to families that speak a total of 48 languages in the home, and the national and cultural backgrounds represented in Greater Falls Church—with its population of almost 90,000—is even more diverse.</p>
    <p>Vision. Making welcoming a social norm is the goal of the Welcoming America movement generally, and one worth pursuing locally. The residents of Falls Church and its elected representatives are responding to the challenge and opportunity of this growing diversity. The first sentence of the City of Falls Church's "Falls Church 2040" strategic plan states that "Falls Church in 2040 will be a welcoming and inclusive community." The Falls Church City Council embraced the ideals of the Welcoming America movement and offered initial momentum last year by declaring the week of September 16, 2018 as "Welcoming Week," and by setting a goal of becoming a "Welcoming City"—a strong statement of support for immigrants and refugees in our community. Now in a second resolution, on September 9, 2019, the City Council is making an even stronger statement about building a "community of neighbors" and supporting the values that Welcoming Falls Church and the Welcoming America movement embrace. Now it's up to us, the residents of Falls Church, to nurture that vision as it comes to fruition.</p>
    <p>We look forward to the next steps growing our movement and calling attention to these issues on the occasion of Welcoming Week, coming soon on September 13-22, 2019.
