    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. How can we do this? Some of this is cultural. We can always smile, prioritize relationships, engage with newcomers (immigrants and otherwise), and bring people together. Culture is contagious, and a welcoming culture brings life.</p>
    <p>In addition, we hope that you will consider learning, serving, and living with us--perhaps in some new ways. Below are some of our thoughts about how we can build a community of neighbors together:</p>

    <p><span class="motive">Learn.</span> Attend author Imbolo Mbue's talk on "Immigration and the American Dream" at GMHS (9/14, 9:00-10:30am) and join the conversation about this topic after her talk. You do NOT need to have read Ms. Mbue's book <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780812998481"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a> to attend this talk. She lived in Falls Church at one point, and she's a world-class speaker on this topic. So consider this a public event that will spark a conversation in the community, and please join in that conversation (register <a href="http://welcomingfallschurch.eventbrite.com">here</a>).</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Learn.</span> Read Imbolo Mbue's book <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780812998481"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a>, considered one of the top narratives of the contemporary immigrant experience -- an Oprah pick, PEN/Faulkner award-winner, NY Times/Washington Post best book of the year, etc. You can also enjoy a podcast review of the book by our podcasting media partner <a href="http://threewaypc.com">Three Way</a> before Ms. Mbue's visit, and later this fall Three Way will release a podcast with Ms. Mbue hosted by Falls Church resident and Three Way creator Erin Keating.</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Learn.</span> Learning is not limited to adults. Do you have a child age 10-15? We recommend the book <a href="https://www.alangratz.com/writing/refugee/">Refugee</a> a by Alan Gratz (and have invited the author to Falls Church for a future author talk). And we're sponsoring the middle school book club at the Mary Riley Styles public library featuring <a href="https://www.alangratz.com/writing/refugee/">Refugee</a> on Thursday, October 17, 7:00pm. (Register at the library, and books are available at the library or at our local bookselling partner One More Page Books)</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Learn.</span> Finally, learn about the facts of immigration and the situation of refugees. The Pew Research Center, which does fantastic survey research on a host of issues, has designed an "email course" about U.S. immigration that you can learn more about here. This class is free and is available any time, anywhere. In addition, Pew's <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/17/key-facts-about-u-s-immigration-policies-and-proposed-changes/">most recent report on immigration</a> will help you understand the complicated landscape of immigration policy. Consider learning together with others in the community and taking action - <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">let us know</a> if you'd like to join a study/discussion group this fall (especially if you'd like to lead such a group).</p>

    <p><span class="motive">Serve.</span> We love the idea of integrating learning and serving. If you have a child of middle school age, they can participate in the book club about <a href="https://www.alangratz.com/writing/refugee/">Refugee</a> and then get involved in a service project we're planning with the Laura Miller, Mary Riley Styles public library Teen Librarian, that connects to the book. (Register at the library or <a href="mailto:lmiller@fallschurchva.gov">email Laura</a>)</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Serve.</span> We also love the idea of partnering with great, local organizations that are doing great work in the community. We love the Falls Church Presbyterian Church's tradition of Welcome Table dinners, open to all comers, on the first and third Wednesday of each month. FCPC needs volunteers for their dinners on the third Wednesday of each month--the next date is coming soon, Wednesday, September 18, 7:00pm. (Register on the <a href="http://www.fallschurchpresby.org/">FCPC website</a>--and this is a regular, twice-monthly service opportunity!) </p>
    <p><span class="motive">Serve.</span> Another great local organization is our partner Comunidad, which operates great afterschool reading and youth leadership programs at the Willston Multi-Cultural Center, a Fairfax County government community center located behind Target at Seven Corners. Join us at an Information Night to "Come & See Comunidad" and learn about their programs, which include opportunities to serve as reading buddies for young children, Thursday, September 19, 5:30-6:30pm. Then consider becoming a regular volunteer. (Register <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer1">here</a> for the Information Night event on September 19--then regular service opportunities will begin later in September and are ongoing, year-round)</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Serve.</span> Spend Yourself Food Pantry (which is sponsored by Columbia Baptist Church) is another great, local organization. We organize a group of eight volunteers on the third Saturday of each month--the next date is coming soon, Saturday, September 21, 8:00-11:30am. This is a great activity for families, bring your children. (Register on Signup Genius <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer">here</a>--this is a regular, monthly service opportunity)</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Serve.</span> The Falls Church City Public Schools (FCCPS) is a great partner and is doing good work with international families. FCCPS's creation of a Family Resource Center (FRC) to serve these families is a great story, and an important one given that FCCPS's ESOL student headcount has increased by 51% over the past four school years (and has increased by a remarkable 69% in the same timeframe if one also considers formerly ESOL students that have exited the program). FCCPS does have one need: the schools are looking for volunteers in the community who have the ability (and time) to translate for parents who are in need of support. If you can potentially help with this, please contact Dr. Jennifer Santiago, FCCPS Coordinator of EL Services, <a href="santiagoj@fccps.org">here</a>.</p>

    <p><span class="motive">Live.</span> We've noticed that many people in Falls Church are readers. Consider joining a book club that we are organizing, and future book discussions that we will bring together. We think that hundreds of people in Falls Church have read <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780812998481"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a> (thank you to FCCPS Superintendant Peter Noonan for making it one of two books he recommended to the community at year-end, and to the Mary Riley Styles Public Library for recommending it all summer). Maybe your book club has read and discussed this -- join one of our book clubs. Meet new people. Maybe you'll meet some people with common interests, that you'll want to meet again. One WFC book club date for a discussion of <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780812998481"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a> is coming up soon - Thursday, September 12, 7:00pm (Sign up <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-book1">here</a>). (Shhh....and for our next recommended book, we'll tell you about <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780316396554">One Goal</a> after Welcoming Week - get your copy at our bookseller partner One More Page Books.)</p>
    <p><span class="motive">Live.</span> Finally, and most ambitiously, think about what you can uniquely do to weave the social fabric of our community. What is your neighborhood like? Who are your friends? Who are your acquaintances? Whatever your situation, bring people together. Hold a block party that would not happen otherwise. Hold a <a href="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1719/Play-Streets-Permit-Pilot-Program">Play Street</a> (this is a great City of Falls Church program). And whatever you do, make a special effort to make newcomers (especially international friends) feel welcome, to overcome one of the principal divisions in our society. It is more important than ever to express a welcoming spirit to people who may not feel as welcome in the United States as we'd like. Whatever your race, creed, ethnic background, or socioeconomic status, join us to express hospitality towards immigrants and refugees, to create opportunity for us all.</p>

    <p>We hope you join us in Welcoming Falls Church. Embrace a welcoming spirit, sign up for one or more activities, and if you have not already done so provide us your information in the form <a href="http://welcomingfallschurch.org/get-involved">here</a>, so that we can be in touch with you proactively about future activities. We look forward to engaging with area residents, civic and business leaders, our schools and many others, to build a community of neighbors.</p>
